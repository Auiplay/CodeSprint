# Prototypes in JavaScript

### Problems with the constructor function

>In the previou [post](https://github.com/rupeshmi/CodeSprint/edit/dev/JavaScript/Part1/Object.md) 
>we discuss about various ways of creating objects in JavaScript.
>One of the ways to create objects in JavaScript is using the **Constructor** function.
>Consider the construction function below:

```javascript
function Human(firstName, lastName){
	this.firstName = firstName,
	this.lastName = lastName,
	this.fullName = function(){
		return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
	}
}
```
>Let's create object **person1** and **person2** using the **Human** constructor function.

```javascript
var person1 = new Human("Virat", "Kohli");
var person2 = new Human("Sachin", "Tendulkar");
```

>On execution of above code, JavaScript engines creates properties firstName, lastName and method fullName for instances person1
>and person2 as shown below:

> i.e. every object created using the constructor function will have it's own copy of properties and methods. 
>It doesnâ€™t make sense to have two instances of function *fullName* that do the same thing. 
>Storing separte instances of function for each ojects results into wastage of memory.
>We will see as we move forward how we can solve this issue.

### Prototypes

>When a function is created in JavaScript, JavaScript engine adds a *prototype* property to the function. 
>This *prototype* property is an oject (called as prototype object) which has a *constructor* property by default. 
>*constructor* property points back to the function on which *prototype object* is a property.
>We can access the function's prototype property using this syntax **functionName.prototype**.

>Let's see an example below:

```javascript
function Human(firstName, lastName){
	this.firstName = firstName,
	this.lastName = lastName,
	this.fullName = function(){
		return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
	}
}

console.log(Human);
```
#### Console output

>To access prototype property of the function *Human* use the below syntax:

```javascript
console.log(Human.prototype)
```
#### Console output

>As seen from the above image *prototype* property of the function is an oject (prototype object) with two properties

1. constructor property which points to  *Human* function itself
2. \_\_proto\_\_ property - We will discuss about this while explaining *inheritance* in JavaScript

### Creating an object using the constructor function

>When an object is created in JavaScript, JavaScript engine adds a \_\_proto\_\_  property to the newly created object
>which is called as *dunder proto*. **dunder proto or \_\_proto\_\_** points to the prototype object of the constructor function.

![](https://github.com/rupeshmi/CodeSprint/blob/dev/JavaScript/Part2/CodeSnippets/HumanObjectProto.png)

>As shown in the above image, **person1** object which is created using the **Human** constructor function has a 
>**dunder proto or \_\_proto\_\_** property which points to the prototype property of the constructor function.

>Let's see this in code:
```javascript
//Create an object person1 using the Human constructor function
var person1 = new Human("Virat", "Kohli");
console.log(person1);
```
#### Console output

![alt text](https://github.com/rupeshmi/CodeSprint/blob/dev/JavaScript/Part2/CodeSnippets/HumanProtoConsole.png)

>As it can be seen from the above image, both person1's *dunder proto or \_\_proto\_\_* property and *Human.prototype* property are equal
>let's check if they point at the some location using === operator

```javascript
Human.prototype === person1.__proto__ //true
```
>This shows that person1's dunder proto property and Human.prototype are pointing to the same object. 

>Now, lets's create an another object *person2* using the *Human* constructor function
```javascript
var person2 = new Human("Sachin", "Tendulkar");
console.log(person2);
```
#### Console output
![](https://github.com/rupeshmi/CodeSprint/blob/dev/JavaScript/Part2/CodeSnippets/person2HumanProto.png)

>Above console output shows that even person2's dunder proto property is equal to the Human.prototype property and they points 
>to the same oject

```javascript
Human.prototype === person2.__proto__ //true
```

>Let's verify if person1's dunder proto and person2's dunder proto points to the same oject

```javascript
person1.__proto__ === person2.__proto__ //true
```
>Above statement proves that the person1's and person2's dunder proto properties points to **Human**  constructor function's prototype object

**Prototype object of the constructor function is shared among all the objects created using the constructor function**

### Prototype object
>As prototype object is an object, we can attach properties and methods to the prototype object. Thus, enabling all the objects created
>using the constructor function to share the properties and methods.

> New property can be added to the constructor function's prototype property using either the dot notation or square bracket notation as
>shown below:
```javascript
Human.prototype.name = "Ashwin";
console.log(Human.prototype.name)//Output: Ashwin
//Square bracket notation
Human.prototype["age"] = 26;
console.log(Human.prototype["age"]); //Output: 26
console.log(Human.prototype);
```
#### Console output

![](https://github.com/rupeshmi/CodeSprint/blob/dev/JavaScript/Part2/CodeSnippets/HumanProtAddProp.png)
>name and age properties have been added to Humam.prototype object

#### Example

```javascript
//Create an empty constructor function
function Person(){

}

//Add property name, age to the prototype property of the Person constructor function
Person.prototype.name = "Ashwin" ;
Person.prototype.age = 26;
Person.prototype.sayName = function(){
	console.log(this.name);
}

//Create an object using the Person constructor function
var person = new Person();
//Access the name property using the person object
console.log(person.name)// Output" Ashwin
```
>Let's analyze what happened when we did **console.log(person.name)**
>Let's check if person object has name property
```javascript
console.log(person);
```
#### Console output
![](https://github.com/rupeshmi/CodeSprint/blob/dev/JavaScript/Part2/CodeSnippets/personEmptyObject.png)

>As we can see that person object is empty and it does not have any property except it's dunder proto property. 
>So how does the output of console.log(person.name) was 'Ashwin'

> Whenever a property is accessed for reading on an object, a search is started to find a property with that name.
>The search begins on the object instance itself. If a property with a given names is found on the instance, then that value
>is returned; if the property is not found, then the search
>continues up the pointer to the prototype, and the prototype is searched for a property with
>the same name. If the property is found on the prototype, then that value is returned. So, when
>person1.name is called, JavaScript engine checks if the property exsit on the person oject. In this 
>case, name property was not on the person's object. So, now JavaScript engine checks if the name property exists on the 
dunder proto property of the person's object. In this cases, name property was there on the dunder proto property of person's object.
>Hence, the output was returned "Ashwin". If the dunder proto property of the person's object does not have the name property
>then dunder proto property of the dunder protot prperty of the person's object was searched and this process will continure till the 
>dunder proto property is null. In this cases output will be *undefined*.
